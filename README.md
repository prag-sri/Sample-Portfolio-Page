Task:
Make a simple portfolio page UI - but only make the components that have been asked below.
UI reference - https://drive.google.com/file/d/1NA-EYid9lUFDd8QJdSW8q82Nk3__Fdzt/view

Requirements
Make your first HTML page, organise your code properly. Make sure you make every section using section tags , the footer should use the footer tag and the header should use the header tag.


Header Component - The header component should consist of an h1 heading as shown which says “Welcome to my website”. After the h1 make a nav bar which uses semantic tags like ul and li to make a UI as shown. Every list item should be wrapped with an anchor tag as the list items are clickable.


Main Component - After the header component use the main tag and make the following sections.

The first section would be the About Me Section. “About Me” will be in h2 and then write a paragraph about yourself in a p tag below it. You can change the para if you want and write something about yourself. Close the section tag.
The second section will be about My Work, again “My Work” will be in h2. and your work will be an ordered list as shown in the UI. You can add as many projects as you want. Again make sure that every list item is wrapped by an anchor tag to be clickable. Close the section.
The third section is Testimonials. The heading again is h2 and every testimonial has been wrapped inside a blockquote. Once done close this section as well.
Pricing Section - The pricing section is also a section which has an unordered list. After this, each list item consists of a heading written in h3, and It has a price which is wrapped inside a p tag. Then every list item has another unordered list inside of it. The nested unordered list just has three more list items inside of it. This nesting is clearly visible in the UI shown.
Footer - in the end we have a simple footer which has the copyright symbol and “2023 - John Doe”. You can change john doe and replace it with your name.
